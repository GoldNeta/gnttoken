## Technical Details

The base contract for GNT is an extension of `ERC20.sol` from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) called `CappedDistributionToken.sol` which enforces a max total supply. When minting tokens it requires the mint to be accounted for which distribution.

`GNT.sol` is simply an initialization of the constructor of `CappedDistributionToken.sol`
